A statistic generater app.

Worked on this in college.

Basically a webapp using JAVA which takes an excell sheet and generates graphs and charts from the data on the browser.

Worked on it long time ago so it's not up to date with latest version.

If you want, figure out how it works. Anyone can use this as reference.
